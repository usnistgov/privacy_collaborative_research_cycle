## Introduction

Welcome!

This repository contains deidentified data submitted to the CRC and their evaluation results as generated by [SDNist v2.2.0](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/releases/tag/v2.2.0). The [CRC homepage](https://pages.nist.gov/privacy_collaborative_research_cycle/) provides more detailed information about the program, its goals, and how to participate. 

In short, the CRC seeks to equip the research community with resources to explore, evaluate, and discuss deidentification approaches. The original data for this project are the [NIST Diverse Communities Excerpts](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/tree/main/nist%20diverse%20communities%20data%20excerpts), curated data drawn from the American Community Survey. 

There are three ground truth partitions, corresponding two three geographic regions (Boston-area (`ma`), Dallas-Fort Worth Area (`tx`), and a national sample (`national`). Submissions may include any or all of these partitions. 

The original data contains 24 features. We also have a list of recommended reduced-size feature sets which can be found in the Excerpts ReadMe. Deidentified data may include any combination of feature set, though we have encouraged participants to use one of the recommended combinations to facilitate comparison of techniques.

## What do we have here? 

[The releases section](https://github.com/usnistgov/privacy_collaborative_research_cycle/releases/) contains the results of submissions. Additional submissions will be added with the next drop expected in July 2023. In the Releases section of this repository, you can access the data. The resources are partitioned into two zip files, one contains the reports generated by our deidentified evaluator, SDNist, and the second zip file contains the actual deidentified data. The deidentified data include meta-information about how each dataset was generated, the feature sets run, and other pertinent information. Some deidentified data sets contain variants (e.g., differentially private data run at two values of epsilon). To learn more about the techniques used to deidentify the data, see the [CRC Techniques page.](https://pages.nist.gov/privacy_collaborative_research_cycle/pages/techniques.html).

In addition to the deidentified data and reports, we are offing metareports (also in the release), that provide a detailed examination of various techniques with a brief discussion. 

## How are the data organized? 

The deidentified data have the following hierarchy:
``` 
	crc_data_and_metric_bundle
		data_and_metric_archive
			index.csv (a navigation guide)
			NIST Diverse Excerpts
			deid_data
				technique_team
					data_partion(s) ('ma', 'tx', and/or 'national')
						report_1
						report_10
						deid_data_e_1.csv (e.g., epsilon=1 data)
						deid_data_e_1.json
						deid_data_e_10.csv (e.g., epsilon=10 data)
						deid_data_e_10.json 
```
