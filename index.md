The CRC is a cooperative program to advance research in privacy-enhancing technologies. Specifically, the CRC is asking researchers to investigate the performance of varying synthetic data generating methods. The CRC will enable the research community to compare differing methods using common evaluation metrics. No prizes will be awarded in this program.

### Phase 1: Exploratory Workshop -- expected Feb 2023 - May 2023

We plan to invite the public to use algorithms create private, synthetic data using the the [Diverse Community Excerpt Data](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/tree/main/nist%20diverse%20communities%20data%20excerpts). The test dataset has a limited number of features (22 columns), and is drawn from highly diverse Census PUMAs. Workshop participants may be invited to submit one or more synthetic datasets with an abstract explaining their methods. The CRC plans to [evaluate the synthetic data performance methods found in this repository.](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/). The CRC plans to release abstracts, submitted synthetic data, and machine-readable evaluation results in an *Acceleration Bundle*. Participants may be invited to a 'Demo Day' (expected May 2023) to discuss their approaches. Participants are encouraged to submit a wide variety of synthesized data, not just the best performing data.

### Phase 2: Explanatory Workshop -- expected May 2023 - Jan 2024

Participants will be asked use the Acceleration Bundle to investigate the performance of varying approaches.  There will be no mandate to address any specific topics. Topics might include examination of performance on data types, trends between geographic regions, effiency and utility of machine learning models, or any other germane dataset. The CRC plans to invite participants to submit papers (10 pages or fewer) describing their findings. The CRC plans to invite authors of accepted papers to give a talk at the culminating conference (expected Jan 2023). Papers may be published as part of conference proceedings.
