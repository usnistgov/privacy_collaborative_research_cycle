# Public Safety Analytics Resource Compendium

The compendium, linked below, was prepared by [yet2](https://www.yet2.com/) and sponsored by NIST's [Public Safety Communications Research Division](https://pscr.gov) under contract number 80JSC017D0029.

NIST and yet2 do not endorse any of these resources or claim this compendium to be comprehensive.

## Compendium Access

[Access the compendium as an MS Excel workbook here.](https://github.com/usnistgov/Public_Safety_Analytics_Resources/raw/main/Compendium%20of%20Open%20Resources%20for%20Multimodal%20Emergency%20Awareness%20AI%20Analytics.xlsx) 

## Contributions

The NIST PSCR program is seeking to identify open-source software frameworks, toolkits and algorithms, datasets, and standards/best practices that could assist in the development of AI-based analytic tools to support real-time analysis of streaming data from public safety communications and data streams that public safety officials must monitor to maintain situation awareness.

Please email gary.howarth@nist.gov or [open an Issue](https://github.com/usnistgov/Public_Safety_Analytics_Resources/issues/new/choose) through out Github site to suggest contributions.

The types of AI software tools of interest support automated data analysis and span the following domains:
