The CRC is a cooperative program to advance research in privacy enhancing technologies. Specifically, the CRC is asking researchers to investigate the performance of varying synthetic data generating methods. The CRC will enable the research community to compare differing methods using common evaluation metrics. No prizes will be awarded in this program.

### Phase 1: Exploratory Workshop -- expected Oct 2022 - Feb 2023

NIST will release a test dataset (expected 6 SEP 2022) and will invite the public to use algorithms to use the dataset to create private, synthetic data. Workshop participants are invited to submit one or more synthetic datasets with an abstract explaining their methods. The CRC will [evaluate the synthetic data performance using a variety of methods](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/). The CRC will release abstracts, submitted synthetic data, and machine-readable evaluation results in an *Acceleration Bundle*. Participants will be invited to a 'Demo Day' (expected 8 FEB 2023) to discuss their methods.

### Phase 2: Explainatory Workshop -- expected Feb 2023 - Aug 2023

Participants will be use the Acceleration Bundle to investigate the performance of varying approaches. The CRC will invite participants to submit papers (10 pages or fewer) describing their findings. Authors of accepted papers will be invited to give a talk at the culminating conference (expected 20 SEP 2023). Papers may be published as part of a conference proceedings, in which case, authors will retain their respective copyrights.
