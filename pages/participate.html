				<h2>How To Participate</h2>
				<p>We invite a wide variety of participation: Spend an
					afternoon to give us a deidentified data sample or a
					summer exploring a math problem inspired by what we’ve
					observed in those samples. And we hope to have a wide
					variety of participants – coders, theorists, and analysts.
					When we collaborate, we need everyone’s expertise. Look
					below to find out more about how you can help.</p>

							<section>
								<p><b>Do I need to be a privacy expert? :</b>
									Nope! We want participants both inside and outside the
									privacy research community. There are a lot of easy-to-use
									tools out there aimed for the general public,
									and we’d like to know how they perform just as much as
									we’d like to understand recent research innovations.
								</p>
								<p><b>What's a submission? :</b>
									To make a deidentified-data submission, first pick a
									privacy technique and a feature subset.
									Then, run the privacy technique on the data with the feature subset you chose.
									You can include multiple files in a data submission to try out different
									parameter settings on your privacy technique.
								</p>
								<p><b>Can I make more than one submission? :</b>
									Yes! The more techniques and feature sets you try out,
									the more we’ll have, and that’s what we want.
									Your team will be given credit for everything you submit,
									and you can even attach a team logo to your submission if you like.
								</p>
								<p><b>What data? :</b>
									<a
										href="https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/tree/main/nist%20diverse%20communities%20data%20excerpts">
										Here is the benchmark data we’d like you to deidentify for us.</a>
									We have three benchmark datasets – the Massachusetts data is from
									north of Boston, the Texas data is from near Dallas, and the National
									data is a collection of very diverse communities from around the nation.
									The data is derived from the 2019 American Community Survey; the 24
									features in the complete scheme were chosen because they capture many
									of the complexities from real-world data, while still being small,
									and simple enough to make more formal analysis feasible.
									The data folder includes lovely postcard documentation about
									the communities and a JSON data dictionary to make it easy to
									configure your privacy technique.
									<a
										href="https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/blob/main/nist%20diverse%20communities%20data%20excerpts/README.md">
										The usage guidance section</a> in the readme
									has helpful configuration hints <b><i>(watch out for ‘N’)</i></b>.
								</p>
								<p><b>What privacy technique? :</b>
									You can pick one to try from our growing collection
									on the <a href="techniques.html">
										Techniques page</a>,
									take a look at our
									<a target="_tab"
										href="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/usnistgov/SDNist/main/deidentification%20techniques/Open_Source_Techniques_for_Privacy_Newcomers.pdf">
										list of open-source libraries for privacy newcomers</a>,
									or you can contribute a new one we don’t have yet.
									If you submit a new technique
									(or a different library implementation of one we already have),
									then the submission form will prompt you for basic information about
									it: a short name, a one-sentence description,
									a full algorithm description (optional),
									and then any links or references that help document it.
									You’ll also have the option of adding a picture that
									people can use to identify the technique at a glance.
									In a few days, you’ll see the technique you contributed added to our website.
									<b><i>Note – you don’t need to be the creator of a privacy technique
											to submit data that uses it; just be sure to properly cite the
											source when prompted.</i></b>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>What feature set? :</b>
									The <a
										href="https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/blob/main/nist%20diverse%20communities%20data%20excerpts/data_dictionary.json">
										full schema has 24 features</a>,
									but you often want to focus on just a subset of those.
									Some privacy algorithms are designed for smaller feature sets,
									and algorithm analysis may be more approachable on focused subsets.
									Of course, it’s also important to see how algorithms behave with
									larger feature sets; the best performing approach on 9 features
									might be the worst performing one on 21.
									Here are some options to try out, and you’re welcome
									to pick your own subset as well.
									A single data submission should use a single feature subset.
								</p>
								<ul class="ul-space-above">
									<li><b>All Features:</b> <i>Includes all 24 features</i></li>
									<li><b>Simpler Features:</b> <i>Includes 21 features,</i>

									<!-- <h4><b>
										Publicly Verifiable Differential Privacy - Special Submission Process
									</b></h4> -->
									<p>In the <a
											href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/76/competition-differential-privacy-maps-3/page/329/#overview">
											NIST Synthetic Data Challenges</a>, NIST provided a
										Subject-Matter-Expert
										<a
											href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/76/competition-differential-privacy-maps-3/page/329/#pre-screening-write-up">differential-privacy
											validation process</a>.
										For the Collaborative Research Cycle, we will be doing something
										more transparent and collaborative instead.
										If you would like to assert that your submission
										technically satisfies Publicly Verifiable Differential
										Privacy, then read more here.
									</p>
									<p><b>Should I participate?</b></p>
									<ul>
										<li>Participation is optional: You are welcome to
											describe your technique as differentially private
											in the submission form without participating in
											the Publicly Verified Differential Privacy track,
											and that’s fine! It just won’t be publicly verified.
										</li>
										<li>
											In particular, if you’re using a tool from a well-known
											differentially private library, and you haven’t
											added any of your own code, then you don’t need to submit
											for public verification.
										</li>
										<li>
											However, if you’re relatively new to differential privacy,
											and you’re writing some of your own code, it’s a great idea
											to submit for verification.
										</li>
										<li>
											And if you’ve been in the differential-privacy
											research community for quite a while, then it’s
											an even better idea to submit for verification.
											This will make it easier for other DP researchers
											to find your work in the archive, and more eyes on
											source code is almost always a good idea.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p></p>
									<p>
										<b>What do I need to participate?</b>
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											On the submission form, you can check that you’d
											like to assert Publicly Verifiable Differential Privacy.
											Then you’ll be prompted to submit a few additional items.
											<b><i>Note that all of these items will be shared publicly as
													part of the public verification process.</i></b>
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Source Code: </b>
											You will need to link to a public code repository
											where your source code can be reviewed.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Privacy Proof and Code Guide Document: </b>
											You will need to upload a written document that
											(1) includes a step-by-step walkthrough of your algorithm,
											(2) states where to find each of the steps in the source code, and
											(3) has a proof that this algorithm satisfies differential privacy
											for your chosen DP variant.
											Note – if you’re new to DP, or even if you’re not,
											it helps to be very methodical about tracking the
											sensitivity of each of your steps.
											This is a different writing style than you’d use for a
											publication; we’re looking for something simple and unambiguous.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Execution Instructions: </b>
											Provide instructions for someone to run your code and reproduce
											the results you got in the data that you’re submitting.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Tuning Approach: </b>
											This is a quick multiple-choice question in the form
											– when you were developing (testing and configuring)
											your technique, did you use any version of the benchmark data?
											To very strictly preserve privacy, it’s best not to use the
											private data during development because it could leak information
											that’s not protected by the privacy guarantee. Options include:
											<ul>
												<li>No data was used for development (default, blind, or privacy-preserving
													configuration).</li>
												<li>TX & MA data were used during development, but the submission
													was run on the National data (in this case, TX & MA are
													considered public development data, and the National
													data is considered the private dataset).</li>
												<li>The same target data was used during development
													and for the submission (this is less strict about preserving privacy,
													but it is just fine for many practical purposes
													– however, because it provides a performance advantage,
													it’s important to note this.)</li>
												<li>Other (if you’ve done something else, let us know).</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Public Point of Contact: </b>
											Provide the email of the person who should be
											contacted if anyone has questions about your approach.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p></p>
									<p>
										<b>What can I expect to occur?</b>
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											The Publicly Verifiable Differential Privacy track is what
											it sounds like: we’ll package these techniques and present

								Research Directory Submission Walkthrough
							</b></h4>
							<p>
								In addition to a 
								directory of deidentification techniques 
								, we also maintain 
								a  
									directory of individuals and groups doing
									related research
								using CRC resources. If you've been making 
								use of CRC resources, we'd love to include you!
							</p>
							<p>
								<a href="research.html#related-research">
								The Related Research Directory 
								</a>
							exists 
								to help researchers find each other 
								and make use of each other's insights. 
								Because everyone in the directory has 
								work referencing the same set of 
								benchmark data, its often easier 
								to build on other's observations 
								and make substantial progress together. 
								To be included in the directory, 
								we only need the following 
								<a href="participate.html#connect">
									(provide by email or during an office hour)
								</a>
								:
								<ul>
									<li>
										<b>Name:</b> (individual or group name)
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Description:</b> 1-2 sentences describing the individual or group, such as research focus,  affiliation(s), etc
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>URL:</b> 1-2 reference links for the group (website, arXiv paper, github, discord)
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>CRC Related Work:</b> 
										A list of any publicly available work that 
										cites CRC resources. Possibilities include 
										arXiv preprints, commercial whitepapers, 
										government technical reports, code or data 
										analytics notebooks--- anything publicly 
										available that documents your observations 
										of CRC resources which might be relevant for 
										other researchers. Please see below for 
										information on the definition of CRC related 
										work and how to cite CRC resources.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Group Type:</b> 
										Academic (including students), 
										Government, Industry, Individual/Recreational
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Point of Contact:</b> 
										How can other researchers contact you?  
										Individual or group email address, or 
										website with a contact form.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>[optional] List of Group Members:</b> 
										Anyone in your group working on CRC related 
										research that you'd like included in the directory
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>[optional] Keywords:</b> 
										A list of keywords for the group's research 
										focus, to make it easier for us to organize 
										groups and make it easier for others to find you.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>[optional] Image:</b> 
										An icon or image you'd like to use for your group.

								How to Cite CRC Resources
							</b></h4>
							<p>
								We define "CRC Related Research" to 
								be work that uses (and cites) any 
								of the resources available on the 
								<a href="archive.html">
									Data and Tools page.
								</a>
								This includes the Diverse Community 
								Excerpts benchmark data, 
								the SDNist Evaluation Tool, 
								the Deidentified Data Archive 
								(including the Algorithm Summary 
								Table, Data and Metrics Archive, 
								or Meta-report Archive), 
								the meta-analysis notebooks and 
								the Pairwise PCA Exploration Tool.
							</p>

							<p>
								Below we provide guidance for citing our data and code resources:

							<p>
								<b>Tiny Papers?: </b>
								We're basing it off 
								the 
								<a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2023/CallForTinyPapers">								
								ICLR tiny paper track 
								</a>
								– you can 
								see some great examples there. 
								We'd like you to describe your 
								research concept/contribution as 
								simply and clearly as you can, 
								making it easy for reviewers and 
								other readers to follow along. 
								Incremental or initial results are 
								just fine. We don't expect you to 
								have everything solved, but we want 
								to know what you've noticed about 
								our data/algorithms and what you've 
								figured out so far. Proofs, detailed 
								experiment results, extended related 
								works, and technical background can 
								go in the appendix.
							</p>
							<div>
								<p><b>Contribution Type:</b> We invite participation from all areas 
									of expertise. Purely theoretical and purely empirical submissions 
									are both welcome, as are any mix of the two. </p>
								<p>
									<b>Some Open Problems:</b> What sorts of problems might you 
									explore in your tiny research paper? There’s a lot of 
									possibilities, but here are some potential things to start 
									thinking about (check out our <a href="workshop.html#orientation">
										PPAI kick-off slide deck</a> for more context):
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li><p><b>Through the looking glass:</b> Why (and how, and when) 
										do data-modeling techniques magnify some parts of 
										the population and shrink others?  
										What’s happening when GANs introduce artifacts 
										or when marginal methods reduce diversity? </p></li>
									<li><p><b>Equity and bias:</b> What happens when a minority 
										demographic has a different pattern of feature 
										correlations than the majority (see regression metric)? 
										Which methods are more or less expressive for retaining 
										these differences and why?</p></li>
									<li><p><b>Consistency:</b> Not only why do some methods automatically 
										avoid record inconsistencies and others 
										don’t – Why do different methods do better on 
										<i>different</i> feature categories? 
										How does epsilon impact this? 
										How can we improve results? </p></li>
									<li><p><b>Granularity:</b> What happens when a feature definition 
										gives fine-grained information on a particular demographic 
										group, causing only that group to be more sparsely spread 
										out across the data space? 
										(Consider RAC1P and AIANHN, or DVET and military veterans). 
										Which privacy approaches handle this more or less gracefully? 
										How can we improve?</p></li>
									<li><p><b>More exciting feature sets:</b> 
										How do these results change when you’re 
										running on 15 features instead of 10? Or all 24? 
										What if you consider weights or household joins?</p></li>
									<li><p><b>Verification:</b> How can you verify 
										that the “Publicly Verified Differential Privacy” 
										submissions are in fact differentially private? 
										Try out your preferred verification approach on 
										these real solutions submitted by the community.</p></li>
