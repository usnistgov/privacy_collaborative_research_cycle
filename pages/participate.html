							<h3>Data Submission Walkthrough</h3>
							<p>Help us explore the behavior of deidentification 
								algorithms on diverse data by submitting deidentified 
								samples of our benchmark data, using privacy techniques 
								that are intended to prepare sensitive private data for 
								public release.</p>
							<p><b>Do I need to be a privacy expert? :</b>
								Nope! We want participants both inside and outside the 
								privacy research community. There are a lot of easy-to-use 
								tools out there aimed for the general public, 
								and we’d like to know how they perform just as much as 
								we’d like to understand recent research innovations.
							</p>
							<p><b>What's a submission? :</b>
								To make a deidentified-data submission, first pick a 
								privacy technique and a feature subset. 
								Then, run the privacy technique on the data with the feature subset you chose. 
								You can include multiple files in a data submission to try out different 
								parameter settings on your privacy technique.
							</p>
							<p><b>Can I make more than one submission? :</b>
								Yes! The more techniques and feature sets you try out, 
								the more we’ll have, and that’s what we want. 
								Your team will be given credit for everything you submit, 
								and you can even attach a team logo to your submission if you like. 
							</p>
							<p><b>What data? :</b> 
								<a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/tree/main/nist%20diverse%20communities%20data%20excerpts">
									Here is the benchmark data we’d like you to deidentify for us.</a>  
								We have three benchmark datasets – the Massachusetts data is from 
								north of Boston, the Texas data is from near Dallas, and the National 
								data is a collection of very diverse communities from around the nation. 
								The data is derived from the 2019 American Community Survey; the 24 
								features in the complete scheme were chosen because they capture many 
								of the complexities from real-world data, while still being small, 
								and simple enough to make more formal analysis feasible. 
								The data folder includes lovely postcard documentation about 
								the communities and a JSON data dictionary to make it easy to 
								configure your privacy technique. 
								<a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/blob/main/nist%20diverse%20communities%20data%20excerpts/README.md">
									The usage guidance section</a> in the readme 
								has helpful configuration hints <b><i>(watch out for ‘N’)</i></b>.</p>
							<p><b>What privacy technique? :</b>
								You can pick one to try from our growing collection 
								on the <a href="techniques.html">
									Techniques page</a>,
								take a look at our 
								<a target="_tab" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usnistgov/SDNist/main/deidentification%20techniques/open_source_techniques_for_beginners.pdf">
								list of open-source libraries for beginners</a>,
								or you can contribute a new one we don’t have yet. 
								If you submit a new technique 
								(or a different library implementation of one we already have), 
								then the submission form will prompt you for basic information about 
								it: a short name, a one-sentence description, 
								a full algorithm description (optional), 
								and then any links or references that help document it. 
								You’ll also have the option of adding a picture that 
								people can use to identify the technique at a glance. 
								In a few days, you’ll see the technique you contributed added to our website. 
								<b><i>Note – you don’t need to be the creator of a privacy technique 
									to submit data that uses it; just be sure to properly cite the 
									source when prompted.</i></b>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>What feature set? :</b>
								The <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/blob/main/nist%20diverse%20communities%20data%20excerpts/data_dictionary.json">
									full schema has 24 features</a>, 
								but you often want to focus on just a subset of those. 
								Some privacy algorithms are designed for smaller feature sets, 
								and algorithm analysis may be more approachable on focused subsets. 
								Of course, it’s also important to see how algorithms behave with 
								larger feature sets; the best performing approach on 9 features 
								might be the worst performing one on 21. 
								Here are some options to try out, and you’re welcome 
								to pick your own subset as well. 
								A single data submission should use a single feature subset. 
							</p>
							<ul class="ul-space-above">
								<li><b>All Features:</b> <i>Includes all 24 features</i></li>
								<li><b>Simpler Features:</b> <i>Includes 21 features,</i>

										Do that first.</a></li>
								<li>Prepare your deidentified data samples, with your

							<h3>Publicly Verifiable Differential Privacy - Special Submission Process</h3>
							<p>In the <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/76/competition-differential-privacy-maps-3/page/329/#overview">
								NIST Synthetic Data Challenges</a>, NIST provided a 
								Subject-Matter-Expert
								<a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/76/competition-differential-privacy-maps-3/page/329/#pre-screening-write-up">differential-privacy validation process</a>. 
								For the Collaborative Research Cycle, we will be doing something 
								more transparent and collaborative instead. 
								If you would like to assert that your submission 
								technically satisfies Publicly Verifiable Differential 
								Privacy, then read more here.</p>
							<h4><b>Should I participate?</b></h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Participation is optional: You are welcome to 
									describe your technique as differentially private 
									in the submission form without participating in 
									the Publicly Verified Differential Privacy track, 
									and that’s fine! It just won’t be publicly verified.
								</li>
								<li>
									In particular, if you’re using a tool from a well-known 
									differentially private library, and you haven’t 
									added any of your own code, then you don’t need to submit 
									for public verification.
								</li>
								<li>
									However, if you’re relatively new to differential privacy, 
									and you’re writing some of your own code, it’s a great idea 
									to submit for verification.
								</li>
								<li>
									And if you’ve been in the differential-privacy 
									research community for quite a while, then it’s 
									an even better idea to submit for verification. 
									This will make it easier for other DP researchers 
									to find your work in the archive, and more eyes on 
									source code is almost always a good idea.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							<h4>
								<b>What do I need to participate?</b>
							</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									On the submission form, you can check that you’d 
									like to assert Publicly Verifiable Differential Privacy.  
									Then you’ll be prompted to submit a few additional items. 
									<b><i>Note that all of these items will be shared publicly as 
										part of the public verification process.</i></b>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Source Code: </b>
									You will need to link to a public code repository 
									where your source code can be reviewed. 
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Privacy Proof and Code Guide Document: </b>
									You will need to upload a written document that 
									(1) includes a step-by-step walkthrough of your algorithm, 
									(2) states where to find each of the steps in the source code, and 
									(3) has a proof that this algorithm satisfies differential privacy 
									for your chosen DP variant. 
									Note – if you’re new to DP, or even if you’re not, 
										it helps to be very methodical about tracking the 
										sensitivity of each of your steps. 
										This is a different writing style than you’d use for a 
										publication; we’re looking for something simple and unambiguous.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Execution Instructions: </b>
									Provide instructions for someone to run your code and reproduce 
									the results you got in the data that you’re submitting.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Tuning Approach: </b>
									This is a quick multiple-choice question in the form 
									– when you were developing (testing and configuring) 
									your technique, did you use any version of the benchmark data? 
									To very strictly preserve privacy, it’s best not to use the 
									private data during development because it could leak information 
									that’s not protected by the privacy guarantee.  Options include:
									<ul>
										<li>No data was used for development (default, blind, or privacy-preserving 
											configuration).</li>
										<li>TX & MA data were used during development, but the submission 
											was run on the National data (in this case, TX & MA are 
											considered public development data, and the National 
											data is considered the private dataset).</li>
										<li>The same target data was used during development 
											and for the submission (this is less strict about preserving privacy, 
											but it is just fine for many practical purposes 
											– however, because it provides a performance advantage, 
											it’s important to note this.)</li>
										<li>Other (if you’ve done something else, let us know).</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Public Point of Contact: </b>
									Provide the email of the person who should be 
									contacted if anyone has questions about your approach.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							<h4>
								<b>What can I expect to occur?</b>
							</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The Publicly Verifiable Differential Privacy track is what 
									it sounds like: we’ll package these techniques and present 
									them to the public for verification.
								</li>
								<li>
									The verification might be empirical, formal, or informal. 
									We’ll be actively encouraging engagement from researchers 
									whose work focuses on validating differential-privacy techniques.
								</li>
								<li>
									Within the constraints of available time, we’ll also provide 
									our own informal review and feedback on any issues we uncover.
								</li>
								<li>
									If you receive feedback that uncovers issues with your 
									technique, you can address them and submit an updated 
									algorithm and sample data.
								</li>

							<h3>Tiny Paper Submission Walkthrough</h3>
							<p>For the Tiny Papers, we’ll be soliciting research 
								observations/results rather than data or algorithms. 
								The formal call will be out later this year, but 
								you’re not required to wait to start 
								thinking about things.</p>
							<p><b>Tiny Papers?:</b> We’re basing it off 
								the ICLR tiny paper track – you can see some 
								<a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2023/CallForTinyPapers">
									great examples there</a>.  We’d like you to describe 
								your research concept/contribution as simply and 
								clearly as you can, making it easy for reviewers 
								and other readers to follow along. 
								Incremental or initial results are just fine. We 
								don’t expect you to have everything solved in September, 
								but we want to know what you’ve noticed about our 
								data/algorithms and what you’ve figured out so far. 
								Proofs, detailed experiment results, extended related 
								works, and technical background can go in the appendix. 
							</p>
							<p><b>Contribution Type:</b> We invite participation from all areas 
								of expertise. Purely theoretical and purely empirical submissions 
								are both welcome, as are any mix of the two. </p>
							<p>
								<b>Some Open Problems:</b> What sorts of problems might you 
								explore in your tiny research paper? There’s a lot of 
								possibilities, but here are some potential things to start 
								thinking about (check out our <a href="results_blog.html#1-introductory-slides">
									PPAI kick-off slide deck</a> for more context):
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li><p><b>Through the looking glass:</b> Why (and how, and when) 
									do data-modeling techniques magnify some parts of 
									the population and shrink others?  
									What’s happening when GANs introduce artifacts 
									or when marginal methods reduce diversity? </p></li>
								<li><p><b>Equity and bias:</b> What happens when a minority 
									demographic has a different pattern of feature 
									correlations than the majority (see regression metric)? 
									Which methods are more or less expressive for retaining 
									these differences and why?</p></li>
								<li><p><b>Consistency:</b> Not only why do some methods automatically

								<li><p><b>Granularity:</b> What happens when a feature definition 
									gives fine-grained information on a particular demographic

								<li><p><b>More exciting feature sets:</b> 
									How do these results change when you’re 
									running on 15 features instead of 10? Or all 24? 
									What if you consider weights or household joins?</p></li>
