        "privacy label detail": "The sdcMicro package includes two functions for local suppression. The function localSuppression() is most commonly used and allows the use of suppression on specified quasi-identifiers to achieve a certain level of k-anonymity for these quasi-identifiers.  For SDNist evaluations, records containing suppressed values were dropped from evaluation metrics (which can only run on non-suppressed values). ",
