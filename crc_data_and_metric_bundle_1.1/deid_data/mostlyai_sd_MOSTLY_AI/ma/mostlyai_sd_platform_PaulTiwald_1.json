        "privacy label detail": "The MOSTLY AI Synthetic Data Platform generates synthetic data based original input data. The usage of synthetic data minimizes privacy risks - such as membership inference, re-identification, and attribute inference - while maintaining the majority of statistical properties of the original data. The privacy of the original data is protected by, first, applying basic outlier protection mechanisms and, second, strong regularization of the generative networks creating the synthetic data.",
