# Collaborative Research Cycle Homepage

## Welcome to the homepage of the Collaborative Research Cycle (CRC), hosted by the [NIST Privacy Engineering Program](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/privacy-engineering).

This page was updated 22 FEB 2023.

## Program Purpose and Introduction

The [NIST Privacy Engineering Program](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/privacy-engineering) has launched the 
Collaborative Research Cycle (CRC) to spur research, innovation, and understanding of data deidentification techniques. 
The CRC is a revolutionary rethinking of the typical data challenge format, using metrics and benchmark data not to 
competitively rank approaches but to drive collaborative research towards better understanding them.

The [NIST Differential Privacy Challenge Series](https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/open-innovation-prize-challenges/past-prize-challenges
/2020-differential-privacy-temporal) saw huge gains in synthetic data generation performance and the publication of a variety of open 
source tools. Yet, evaluating and benchmarking synthetic data remains difficult. NIST seeks to assist to the research community in overcoming research barriers by releasing new data and evaluation tools to investigate the performance of synthetic data generators. 

The [Diverse Community Excerpt Data](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/tree/main/nist%20diverse%20communities%20data%20excerpts) are 
real-world, limited-feature data (24 columns), drawn from the American Community Survey and divided into three distinct geographic partitions. The complimentary [SDNist Deidentified Data Report Generator](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist) provides a suite of both machine- and human-readable outputs with more than ten metrics including univariate and multivariate statistics, database distance metrics, principal component analysis, propensity, basic privacy evaluation, and other information-rich tools. 

The CRC collects, evaluates, and packages contributed deidentified Diverse Community Excerpt Data as a *research acceleration bundle*. 
The CRC invites researchers to use this *research acceleration bundle* for investigation, comparison, and analysis and to submit 
their findings to a workshop


## Program Summary in Four Sentences:

The CRC invites researchers to contribute deidentified records from the 
[NIST Diverse Community Excerpts](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/tree/main/nist%20diverse%20communities%20data%20excerpts) 
along with a brief abstract listing their methods. In May 2023, the CRC plans to release a machine-readable _research 
acceleration bundle_ of all contributions along with detailed evaluations using the [SDNist report tool]
(https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/). We invite researchers to use the acceleration bundle to perform analysis 
and submit their findings in 3-page-or-less _[tiny papers](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2023/CallForTinyPapers)_
 to a workshop to be held in November 2023. Submitted papers and NIST-contributed research will be packaged in a 
 set of conference proceedings we expect to release in January 2024. Prizes and awards are not part of this program.

## Hints, Tips, and Recommendations:


* [Check out the introductory slide deck (6MB)](PDFs/CRC_NIST_introduction.pdf)
* This program is designed to encourage apples-to-apples comparisons of various synthetic generator and de-identification techniques. Following these tips improves the likelihood of fair, meaningful comparisons.
* Read through the [SDNist](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist) and [NIST Diverse Community Data Excerpts](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist/tree/main/nist%20diverse%20communities%20data%20excerpts) READMEs.
* You will submit CSV data and your abstract. We will package those along with the SDNist evaluation reports in the research acceleration bundle.
* There are two main abstract types: those asserting publicly verifiable formal privacy (e.g., differential privacy), and everything else. To participate in the verifiable formal privacy track, you are expected to share a link to your code base so the community can verify your claims.
* The data has 24 features. In order to facilitate comparisons of techniques we recommend deidentifiying the entire feature set or choose one of the following subsets:
    * Full features without weights or INDP
    * Basic 9 features: AGEP, SEX, MSP, RAC1P, HOUSING_TYPE, OWN_RENT, EDU, PINCP_DECILE, DVET, DEYE
    * Small categorical: SEX, RAC1P, PUMA, PINCP_DECILE, OWN_RENT
    * Tiny categorical:  RAC1P, PUMA
* If you use differential privacy we ask you to provide values of epsilon and delta. If using a relaxation of differential privacy (e.g., Rényi DP), we ask you to convert your privacy guarantees to epsilon and delta values and highly recommend you set delta = 10<sup>-5 </sup>and from there determine your value of epsilon.
